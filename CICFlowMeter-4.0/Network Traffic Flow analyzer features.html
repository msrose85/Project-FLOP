<h2>Network traffic Flow analyzer: </h2>
</header>
NetFlowMeter is a network traffic flow generator which has been written in Java and offers more flexibility in terms of choosing the features you want to calculate, adding new ones, and also having a better control of the duration of the flow timeout.

CICFlowMeter generates Bidirectional Flows (Biflow), where the first packet determines the forward (source to destination) and backward (destination to source) directions, hence the 83 statistical features such as Duration, Number of packets, Number of bytes, Length of packets, etc are also calculated separately in the forward and reverse direction.

The output of the application is the CSV file format with six columns labeled for each flow, namely FlowID, SourceIP, DestinationIP, SourcePort, DestinationPort, and Protocol with more than 80 network traffic features.

Note that TCP flows are usually terminated upon connection teardown (by FIN packet) while UDP flows are terminated by a flow timeout. The flow timeout value can be assigned arbitrarily by the individual scheme, e.g. 600 seconds for both TCP and UDP.<br><br>

<h3>About CICFlowmeter (Formerly ISCXFlowMeter)</h3>
<p>
CICFlowMeter is a network traffic flow generator distributed by CIC to generate 84 network traffic features. It reads pcap file and generate a graphical report of the features extracted and also provides csv file of the report. It is an open source application written in Java and can be downloaded from Github. Its source codes can be integrated to a project as it offers more flexibility in terms of choosing the features you want to calculate, adding new ones, and also having a better control of the duration of the flow timeout. </p>
